\title{Good Features to Track}
\usage{
goodFeaturesToTrack(
  image,
  max_corners,
  quality_level,
  min_distance,
  mask = NULL,
  block_size = 3,
  gradient_size = 3,
  use_harris = FALSE,
  k = 0.04
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{An 8-bit (8U) single-channel (GRAY) binary \code{\link{Image}}
object.}

\item{max_corners}{The maximum number of corners to return.
\code{max_corners <= 0} implies that no limit on the maximum is set and all
detected corners are returned.}

\item{quality_level}{The minimal accepted quality of the image corners. The
parameter value is multiplied by the best corner quality measure, which is
the minimal eigenvalue (if \code{use_harris = FALSE}) or the Harris function
response (if \code{use_harris = TRUE}). The corners with a quality measure
lower than the product are rejected. For example, if the best corner has a
quality measure of 1500, and \code{quality_level = 0.01}, then all the
corners with a quality measure lower than 15 are rejected.}

\item{min_distance}{The minimum possible Euclidean distance between the
returned corners.}

\item{mask}{A single-channel (GRAY) 8-bit (8U) \code{\link{Image}} object
with the same dimensions as \code{image}. This can be used to mask out
pixels that should not be considered when searching for corners (pixels
set to 0 in the mask will be ignored during the search).}

\item{block_size}{Size of an average block for computing a derivative
covariation matrix over each pixel neighborhood (default: 3).}

\item{gradient_size}{Aperture parameter for the Sobel operator used for
derivatives computation (default: 3).}

\item{use_harris}{A logical indicating whether the corners should be detected
using the Harris method or the eigenvalue method (default: FALSE).}

\item{k}{The free parameter of the Harris detector (ignored if
\code{use_harris = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A matrix with 2 columns corresponding to the x and y coordinates of
 the detected points.
}
\description{
\code{goodFeaturesToTrack} finds the most prominent corners in
 an image or in a specified region of the image.

\examples{
balloon <- image(system.file("sample_img/balloon1.png", package = "Rvision"))
balloon_gray <- changeColorSpace(balloon, "GRAY")
corners <- goodFeaturesToTrack(balloon_gray, 100, 0.01, 10)
